# All Positive Integers in Ascending Order

## About

A list of all positive integers in ascending order.

## Why?

Computation is expensive. Listing integers in ascending order is a solved problem. Why should we waste all those compute cycles re-generating lists over and over for iterators when we could just fetch this list with an HTTP request and be done!

## Is This A Serious Project?

This is a very serious project for very serious people. We take this very, seriously. Very seriously indeed.

## Progress

The list is not yet complete but we are adding more as we can. Currently we estimate our progress at about 0.0%.

## Estimated Timeline

Yeah don't hold your breath.

## Can I contribute?

Yes, contributions from anyone are very welcome. No experience required. See our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information about how to get involved.
