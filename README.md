# All Positive Integers in Ascending Order

## About

A list of all positive integers in ascending order.

## But Why Though?

Computation is expensive. Listing integers in ascending order is a solved problem. Why should we waste all those compute cycles re-generating lists over and over for iterators when we could just fetch this list with an HTTP request and be done!

## Are You For Real?

I don't know are *you* for real? Are any of us for real? Does anything really exist or is this all some kind of simulation. I mean, we probably do and it's probably not, but we don't know for sure.

## Progress

The list is not yet complete but we are adding more as we can. Currently we estimate our progress at about 0.0%.
